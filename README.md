# WereldWijde Weetjes

This website is going to fill a very specific need. My mother is a primary school teacher and she had a great
idea that fills a need in her and her collegaues classes. Like every day there is a schedule of what the kids
are going to do on that day. But there is always some overlap from one topic to the other or even like right
before a break or the end of the day.

Now we are going to fill this time with something that is both fun and educational. WereldWijde Weetjes is going
to take the kids all over the world without them ever having to leave their classroom. My mother travels a lot and
has a lot of content and fun facts from all around the world. On this site the kids wil learn not from books and reading
but just from watching and listening the way they are used to with all the technoligy of today!
